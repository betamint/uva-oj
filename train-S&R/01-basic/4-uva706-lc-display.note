This problem shouldn't have taken me much time, but the mustakes.

1. index of 2D array mistyped
2. try 3 different solutions, factually they are all the same
3. miss understand the output format at first
4. mistake in "screen[][] = figure[][][ p(index) ]" : wrong index
5. too much time in rebuilding the program

Always be careful when dealing with index!
Make things clear!
